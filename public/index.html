The first protocol under development is the adChain Registry, a decentralized whitelist of non-fraudulent publisher domain names. Other protocols for creative registration and verification, impression tracking, and malware detection, will be added in the future.</p><p>These protocols provide a foundation for decentralized application developers to build on, enabling advertisers and publishers to run campaigns that leverage the power of Ethereum while maintaining the familiar user experience of legacy tools. The applications built on adChain will drive adoption across the thousands of advertisers, publishers and technology providers in the digital advertising ecosystem.</p></div></div><div class="ui accordion"><div class="title"><i class="dropdown icon"></i> What is the adChain Registry?</div><div class="content"><p>The adChain Registry is a public decentralized whitelist of online publisher websites which aims to help the advertising industry solve its $16+ billion fraud problem. In this context "decentralized" means that no single entity has control over the whitelist. Instead, the decisions about which publishers are able to join the whitelist are made collectively by the adToken (ADT) holding members of the adChain community.</p></div></div><div class="ui accordion"><div class="title"><i class="dropdown icon"></i> Why is fraud such a big problem?</div><div class="content"><p>Fraud at such a massive scale (+$16 billion ) is made possible by the lack of transparency in the digital advertising supply chain. Advertisers often don't know which websites the ads they buy end up on, leaving room for malicious publishers with mostly bot traffic to profit at their expense. This problem is exacerbated by the large number of intermediaries in a typical programmatic advertising supply chain. A single ad impression can transact between dozens of parties that sit between the advertiser and the publisher. These intermediaries, who are often paid on a per impression basis, may have limited incentive to report questionable traffic, since anybody who reports fraud down the line forfeits their own revenue by doing so.</p></div></div><div class="ui accordion"><div class="title"><i class="dropdown icon"></i> How does the adChain Registry work?</div><div class="content"><p>The adChain Registry employs the adToken (ADT) holding members of the adChain community to help vet publishers who wish to join. The application process for a publisher is as follows:</p><ol><li>A publisher submits an application which includes an ADT deposit.</li><li>A "challenge period" starts during which any ADT holder who believes the publisher is fraudulent can issue a challenge and match the publisher's ADT deposit.</li><li>If no challenges are issued during the challenge period, the publisher is accepted into the adChain Registry, and their deposit is returned.</li><li>If a challenge is issued, the publisher and challenger go head-to-head and ADT holders vote (1 ADT = 1 vote; majority rules) on the outcome.</li><li>The winner of this vote has their ADT deposit returned to them and is rewarded some fraction of the the loser's deposit. The remainder of the loser's deposit is divided amongst the majority voters.</li><li>If the vote is in favor of the publisher, they are accepted into the adChain Registry. If the vote is in favor of the challenger, the publisher is not accepted.</li></ol><p>For more detailed information, please see the <a href="/white-paper.pdf" target="_blank">adChain Registry whitepaper</a>.</p></div></div><div class="ui accordion"><div class="title"><i class="dropdown icon"></i> How might a challenge work in practice?</div><div class="content"><p>In practice, fraudulent publishers will most likely be challenged by existing business partners or their safety vendors after enough evidence of fraud is accumulated to be persuasive to the ADT holding members of the adChain community.</p></div></div><div class="ui accordion"><div class="title"><i class="dropdown icon"></i> How does the adChain Registry solve advertising fraud?</div><div class="content"><p>The adChain Registry does not solve fraud directly, instead it provides the advertising industry with a platform through which to collectively define what fraud is and where to draw the line (e.g. 10% questionable traffic? 20%?). Further, the adChain Registry provides direct financial incentives to those challenging fraudulent publishers and to those participating in the voting process.</p><p>Compare the decentralized adChain Registry with a traditional way of solving this problem: trusting a single database to maintain a whitelist of non-fraudulent publishers. The traditional solution -- a centralized whitelist -- doesn't require a blockchain, doesn't need a token, and is far cheaper and easier to operate. It could be run on a spreadsheet! The centralized solution, however, comes with a significant disadvantage: trust. The value of a centralized whitelist depends on the collective trust placed in its contributors to not list URLs they know to be fraudulent.</p><p>On the other hand, the integrity of the adChain Registry does not depend on trust in any single centralized solution or the reliability of any given contributor, but rather trust in the continued collective financial incentives of all ADT holders – i.e. the strength of the participants in the ecosystem - to challenge URLs and publishers they believe to be fraudulent.</p></div></div><div class="ui accordion"><div class="title"><i class="dropdown icon"></i> How are incentives aligned to challenge fraud in adChain?</div><div class="content"><p>Beyond the direct ADT reward for challenging or participating in an ADT vote against a rejected publisher, the ADT holding members of the adChain community also share an incentive to increase the value of ADT. The relationship between the value of ADT and the integrity of the adChain registry is described in greater detail in the whitepaper, but the summary is:</p><ul><li>The fewer fraudulent publishers in the adChain Registry, the more advertisers will want to do business with the adChain Registry members</li><li>The more advertisers want to do business with adChain Registry members, the more publishers will want to join</li><li>The more publishers want to join, the greater the demand for adToken</li><li>The greater the demand for adToken, the more valuable adToken becomes</li></ul><p>To look at this same relationship from the opposite perspective, it holds that should the adChain Registry have a large number of fraudulent publishers, advertisers won't want to do business with its members, publishers won't want to join it, and the value of adToken is likely to decline.</p><p>As a result of this relationship, rational adToken voters who wish to see the value of their adToken increase will do their best to challenge and vote against the applications of publishers they consider fraudulent.</p></div></div><div class="ui accordion"><div class="title"><i class="dropdown icon"></i> Who will use adChain?</div><div class="content"><p>The goal of adChain is to be inclusive and to onboard the entire digital advertising ecosystem. Initially, the target users will be premium publishers who wish to join the adChain Registry and advertisers who wish to work with them.
