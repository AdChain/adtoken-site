          Once MetaX completes your purchase, MetaX will seek to send
          confirmation of the purchase to you electronically at the email
          address MetaX has on file or otherwise make such confirmation
          available via the Services. You acknowledge and agree that any failure
          of to provide such confirmation, or your failure to receive and/or
          read such confirmation, shall not invalidate any purchase. You may not

          You are solely responsible for determining what, if any, taxes are

          the correct tax amount to the appropriate tax authority in each
          relevant jurisdiction. MetaX has no responsibility to determine,
          collect, report, withhold or remit any taxes in connection with any

        <p className="mb-4">
          In order to complete your purchase of the tokens, you will be required
          to send Funds (which may include digital or virtual currencies, cash
          or other means of payment) to the relevant wallet identified by MetaX,
          via the Services or otherwise. You may be required to verify that you
          control the external account that you use to send the Funds. To the
          extent you are charged a fee to send the Funds, it is your
          responsibility to pay and not anyone else's. You are solely
          responsible for your use of any external account, and you agree to
          comply with all terms and conditions applicable to any external
          account. The timing associated with a transfer of Funds for a purchase
          will depend upon the third parties responsible for maintaining the
          external account, and Metax takes no responsibility in that
          connection. If Funds are not received on a timely basis, MetaX may
          cancel your purchase of tokens without any liability to you.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          If you have sent an insufficient amount of Funds to complete the
          purchase of the tokens, we may cancel the entire order or may fulfill
          a partial order using the amount of Funds available, but we have no
          obligation to alert you to the insufficiency.
